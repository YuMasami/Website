            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    "I stole it?"
No, I don't know what you’re talking bout
You bluff away with this charade that I can't
Figure out
My darling
You cross your heart and then you hope to
Die
So keep on lying to my face and see if I
Comply

"I stole it?
No, I don't know what you’re talking bout
You speak clichés and reap the praise of all the fools in doubt
My darling
Why can't you see that there's no fooling
Me?
Our love is much more of a mess than even you could be

Blah, blah, blah, blah, do me a favor and
Shut up for now
You think you sound clever, but 'cause I
Know better, you sound just too loud
Try to escape and you'll see that you don't
Have a place left to hide
So speak of the devil, but know that you're
Summoning me to your side

1,2... 1,2,3

Dance away, you li-i-iar
Your loving burns like fi-i-ire
Only you, only me, let's tear these vows to
Shreds
And let death do us pa-a-art

Poison me, you li-i-iar
Our love is old and tired
So cover your nose and swallow me away
I’ll get into your veins
And then we’ll meet our end

"I stole it?"
No, I don't know what you’re talking 'bout
You bluff away with this charade that I can't
Figure out
It's hidden
It’s tucked away somewhere that's safe and
Sound
I hear you loud and clear, so baby, there's no
Need to shout

"You got me!
No wait, I've got no clue, what could you
Mean?
Caught you again today, again you slip away
From me
You're sinking
Digging your grave deeper and deeper down
For all your talk, I see you're nothing but a
Helpless clown
Everyone and my own mother is starting to
Make fun of you
'Cause nothing about all the lies that you tell
Yourself seem to sound true
But in the end, you're the beautiful liar who's
Stolen my heart
You're just the devil, but I'm on your level
So drag me down now

1,2... 1, 2,3

Dance with me, you li-i-ar
I'm gonna take us higher
Only you, only me, we're guilty as they come
And though our love is wro-o-ong

Now I've got you, Ii-i-ar
So look me in the ey-y-ye now
Hello, how are you?
Our punishment and crime
Will never go awa-a-ay
No, it's far too late
All the things that I should hate
But the moon is in the sky
So guess
This is goodbye
